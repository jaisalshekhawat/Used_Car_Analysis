**Automobile Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing**

**Overview**

This project involves loading, cleaning, and preprocessing an automobile dataset. The dataset contains various attributes related to automobiles, such as make, price, horsepower, and fuel efficiency. The goal is to clean missing values, standardize data types, and prepare the dataset for further analysis.

**Features**

Download the Dataset: Fetch the dataset from a given URL.

Load Data: Read the CSV file using Pandas.

Explore Data: Display basic information and preview the dataset.

**Data Cleaning:**

Replace missing values represented as ? with NaN.

Drop rows where price data is missing.

Convert numerical attributes to appropriate data types.

Save Processed Data: Export the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.
